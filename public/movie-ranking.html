<h1>The Best Anime According to Yahya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 animes of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Violet Evergarden</h3>
<p>This has to be my favourite anime by far. This anime has all the elements, visually it is pleasing, story is beautifully written, and every episode makes you feel emotions you never knew you had</p>
<h3>Hellsing Ultimate</h3>
<p>As much as I love a beautiful heart wrenching story, sometimes it is about going all out and killing everything that comes in your way.</p>
<h3>Yuru Camp</h3>
<p>This anime is a no-brainer, just a time beautifully protraited time killer, just grab a snack and relex with yuru camp.</p>
